			<h3><b>UX/UI Researcher at Research Entrepreneurs Accelerating Prosperity (REAP) - University of Waterloo</b></h3>

			<p><b> What is REAP? </b></br> "REAP stands for Research Entrepreneurs Accelerating Prosperity. REAP brings creative academic and private sector experts to explore new technologies –especially those involving interactivity, responsiveness, and digital display environments – in order to spark “research entrepreneurship.” Research entrepreneurship departs from the traditional “lab to patent” model. It focuses more on finding new applications of, and uses for, emerging technologies than on creating technologies from scratch. Specifically, this model encourages researchers to turn creativity into prosperity by engaging in innovation and entrepreneurship." - REAP</p>

			<p><b>My Role as a student researcher</b></br> I was granted the opportunity to pursue my own research project. Since I am interested in potential future applications of virtual reality (VR), I explored combining the Oculus Rift with the Kinect to allow mobility and control in a virtual universe. My second project analyzed the best UI practivced for VR. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hbILRH5V_cIoVE4rd8ixHybtWT_LrdrtsjEZa3wcsnk/edit">Link to report.</a><br><br>

			As a researcher, I was given 10 hours to complete the project over the span of 2 to 3 weeks. I created a schedule which allowed me to complete the large project regardless of the limited time. My schedule comprised of smaller tasks of all the things that I needed to get done to complete the overall research project. For example, the first step was to figure out which platform or software I would need to work with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift. I followed through on my commitments by going to the lab regularly and on time. Just like any research project, I was bound to run into various problems, but I quickly reacted and responded to these technical difficulties by using my resources and skills in the field. Some of these resources included searching the web for information from other developers who tried to build similar scenarios for the Oculus Rift and the Kinect, or asking my supervisor for help from people in the lab who worked with the equipment I used. My supervisor also gave me some emails of professors I contacted. I planned meetings with them and told them the issues I came across and listened to their advice. If I encountered issues that had not been previously solved, I persistently worked through them, trying every possible solution I could think of. If I got stuck on an issue I strategically took breaks to work on other aspects of the research project. After a break, I revisited the issue until I solved them or recorded what I knew about them. Throughout the whole process, I regularly assessed my work and updated my supervisor to make sure everything ran smoothly. <br> <br>

			All my goals and deadlines in a timely manner; and as a result, I was able to successfully combine the Oculus Rift with the Kinect. I reviewed my work and wrote a blog post on what I learned, and what could be done in the future if I continued the project. During the VR project, I learned that the Kinect is not a very accurate tool for the detection of body positioning. This project helped me realize that I would love to look into new technology which could accomplish tasks similar to those carried out by the Kinect. My perseverance in the face of pitfalls aided me in learning many technical skills that I applied in my next project on user interfaces with VR.</p>
