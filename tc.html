			<h3><b>UX Strategist at Trusted Clothes</b></h3>

			<p><b> Who is Trusted Clothes? </b></br> Trusted Clothes is a non-profit organization linking people, organizations and brands that are ethical, environmentally friendly and health conscious. They are dedicated to promoting ethical, sustainable and healthy fashion.</p>

			<p><b>My Role at Trusted Clothes</b></br> As a summer student intern I was responsible for redesigning the website, SEO, and blog content editing.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px"><b>Tools Used</b>
				<section style="padding-left: 20px; border-top-width: 0px">
					<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
					<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
					<li>Atlassian Confluence and Jira </li>
					<li>GitHub</li>
					<li>Google Analytics</li>
					<li>Wordpress</li>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0px"><b>Design Process</b></br>
			Before I picked up any projects I did extensive research on non-profit organization website designs. I then created a content audit of the current website that I was working on that could easily be updated through Confluence. I assigned tasks to myself, content writers and programmers through Jira.
			<section style="padding-left: 20px">
			<b>Define the problem:</b> As a UX strategist I started working on each assignment by first understanding the problem and defining it. This step allows me to work more efficiently and understand the user's and team lead's need.
			</br><b> Research:</b> I gathered data on the website usage from Google Analytics, analyises good and bad qualities from our competitors, interviewed some users, and reviewed previous design itterations.
			</br><b> Brainstorm solutions:</b> Based off of the research, I wrote down various solutions and analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of each solution.
			</br><b> Develop mockups and/or prototypes:</b> I started by using pen and paper prototypes, then I redesigned the successful designs on Illustrator, and shared the documents with the front end web developper.
			</br><b> Test:</b> Implementations were tested in the office with volunteer users and through Google Analytics.
			</br><b> Improve and repeat:</b> Data from the user testing was gathered to improve designs and concepts. </section></p>

			<p><b>Future Improvements</b></br>Since everyone on the team was new and it was our first time working on web develpment we did not know how to implement a clear and efficient workflow until a few weeks into our internships. If I were to work again on a web development team I would ask the team members if they have a workflow system that has worked efficiently for them and if not I would share a posible system for the team. The team progress would be tracked and by the end of each week it would be good to have a meeting to see what worked well and what could be improved. This keeps everyone on the same page and minimizes confusion and miscommunication within teams. </p>
